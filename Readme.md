This repo records some cryptography projects done during the learning process

The projects are as follows:

- Implement length extension attack  for SM3.

- Implement Merkle Tree.

- Implement length extension attack for SHA256.

- My optmized implemention for SM3.

- naive birthday attack of reduced SM3.
