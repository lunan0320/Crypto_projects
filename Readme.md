------

The finished projects are as follows:

✅ Project: Implement **Merkle Tree**.

✅ Project: naive **birthday attack** of reduced SM3.

✅ Project: Implement **length extension attack**  for SM3.

✅ Project: Implement the **Rho method** of reduced SM3.

✅ Project:  implement and try to **optimize SM3**.

✅ Project:  report on the application of this deduce technique in **Ethereum with ECDSA**

✅ Project:  **Forge a signature** to pretend that you are Satoshi

✅ Project: research report on **MPT**

- Project: verify the above pitfalls with proof-of-concept code
- Project: Implement the above ECMH scheme
- Project: Implement a PGP scheme with SM2
- Project: implement sm2 2P sign with real network communication
- Project: implement sm2 2P decrypt with real network communication

- Project: send a tx on Bitcoin testnet, and parse the tx data down to every bit, better write script yourself
- Project: Write a circuit to prove that your CET6 grade is larger than 425.
